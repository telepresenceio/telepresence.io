				<p>
					I’m Blake Miller, Platform Architect at{' '}
					<a href="https://www.iris.tv">IRIS.TV</a>. IRIS.TV is a video
					personalization and programming platform. Media customers use IRIS.TV
					to increase their video views and audience engagement, among other
					things. The IRIS.TV platform consists of about 30 services, written in
					a wide variety of programming languages including Ruby, Python,
					JavaScript, Clojure, R, and Go. In addition, there are a wide variety
					of stateful services including Redis, Kafka, MongoDB, Cassandra, and
					MySQL.

				<h2>
					<span className="purpleText">Ambassador:</span> Why did you choose
					Telepresence and <a href="https://forge.sh">Forge</a>?
				</h2>
				<p>
					We’re working to improve productivity, accuracy, and autonomy, which
					is especially important as we begin adding remote engineers. We wanted
					to reduce the cognitive burden of each engineer maintaining a
					development environment, so our engineers can focus as much as
					possible on the specific challenges and opportunities of our business.
					We are also evolving our production infrastructure towards
					microservices in Kubernetes and need an efficient and complete
					development setup in that context. When I heard the approach that
					these tools take, I was immediately excited to try it. The alternative
					is quite cumbersome.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<span className="purpleText">Ambassador:</span> Do you have any advice
					for people looking to adopt Telepresence?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Best practices around development workflow definitely take time to get
					right, they need to fit your organization, and they warrant a lot of
					consideration since they impact everything you do. There is no "one
					size fits all" approach. This is an ongoing process, it's important to
					continue examining (ideally, measuring) the way your team works,
					reflecting on it, and refining it. Testing your workflow with a small
					set of users, and incrementally rolling it out is a good strategy.
					Also,{' '}
					<a href="https://slack.cncf.io/">talk with the team behind Telepresence</a>{' '}
					on their #telepresence-oss Slack chat; they can provide good advice and perspective.
