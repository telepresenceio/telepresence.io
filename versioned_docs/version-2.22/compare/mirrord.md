## Telepresence

Telepresence is a very feature rich tool, designed to handle a large majority of use-cases. You can use it as a cluster VPN only, or use one of its three different ways (replace, intercept, or ingest) to engage with the cluster's resources.

Telepresence is intended to be installed in the cluster by an administrator and then let clients connect with a very limited set of permissions. This model is generally required by larger companies.

The client can be either completely contained in Docker or run directly on the workstation. The latter will require the creation of a virtual network device, and hence admin access.

## mirrord

Mirrord was designed with simplicity in mind. You install the CLI tool, and that's it. It will do the rest automatically under the hood.

Mirrord solves the same problem as Telepresence, but in a different way. Instead of providing a proper network
device and remotely mounted filesystems, mirrord will link the client application with a `mirrord-layer` shared library. This library will intercept accesses to the network, file system, and environment variables, and reroute them to a corresponding process in the cluster (the `mirrord-agent`) which then interacts with the targeted pod.

### Limitations

While mirrotd is simple to set up, the chosen approach has several limitations, both on the client and the cluster side.

### Limitations when using dynamic loading:

1. It will only work on Linux and macOS platforms. There's no native support on Windows.
2. It will only work with dynamically linked executables.
3. It cannot be used with docker unless you rebuild the container and inject the `mirrord-layer` into it.
4. `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` causes various problems on macOS (SIP prevents it from being used), especially on silicon-based machines where mirrord will require Rosetta.
5. Should Apple decide to protect their intel-based platform the same way as the silicon-based one in a future release, then mirrord will likely be problematic to use on that platform.

### Cluster Permissions

Mirrord does not require a sidecar. Instead they install a the `mirror-agent` into the namespace of the pod that it impersonates. That agent requires several permissions that a cluster admin might consider a security risk:

* `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_RAW` - required for modifying routing tables
* `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` - required for reading target pod environment
* `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` - required for joining target pod network namespace

Unless using "mirrord for Teams" (proprietary), all users must have permissions to create the job running the `mirror-agent` in the cluster.

[^1]: Telepresence will not require root access on the workstation when running in docker mode.

[^2]: The remote service will only restart when a traffic-agent sidecar is installed. Pod disruption budgets or pre-installed agents can be used to avoid interruptions.

[^3]: A traffic-agent is necessary when engaging with a pod. It is unnecessary when using Telepresence as a VPN.
