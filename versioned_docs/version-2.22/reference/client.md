# Client reference

The [Telepresence CLI client](../quick-start.md) is used to connect Telepresence to your cluster, start and stop intercepts, and create preview URLs. All commands are run in the form of `telepresence <command>`.

## Commands

A list of all CLI commands and flags is available by running `telepresence help`, but here is more detail on the most common ones.
You can append `--help` to each command below to get even more information about its usage.

| Command          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `completion`     | Generate a shell completion script for bash, zsh, fish, or powershell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `config view`    | View current Telepresence configuration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
| `connect`        | Starts the local daemon and connects Telepresence to a namespace in your cluster. After connecting, outbound traffic is routed to the cluster so that you can interact with services as if your laptop was another pod (for example, curling a service by it's name)                                                                                                                                               |
| `curl`           | curl using a containerized executable that shares the network established by a connect. Especially useful when using `connect --docker`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `docker-run`     | run a docker image in a container that shares the network established by a connect.  Especially useful when using `connect --docker`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `gather-logs`    | Gather logs from traffic-manager, traffic-agents, user, and root daemons, and export them into a zip file that can be shared with others or included with a github issue. Use `--get-pod-yaml` to include the yaml for the `traffic-manager` and `traffic-agent`s. Use `--anonymize` to replace the actual pod names + namespaces used for the `traffic-manager` and pods containing `traffic-agent`s in the logs. |
| `helm install`   | Install the traffic-manager using the helm chart embedded in the telepresence executable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
| `helm upgrade`   | Upgrade the traffic-manager using the helm chart embedded in the telepresence executable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
| `helm uninstall` | Uninstall the traffic-manager and all traffic-agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `ingest`         | Ingest a container to get access to its mounted volumes and environment variables: `telepresence ingest <workload name> --container <container name> --env-file <file>` When used with a `--` separator, this command can also start a process so you can run a local instance of the ingested container.                                                                                                          |
                                                  |
| `intercept`      | Intercepts a service to get its ingress traffic routed to the workstation and access to its mounted volumes and environment variables: `telepresence intercept <service name> --port <TCP/UDP port>` (use `port/UDP` to force UDP). When used with a `--` separator, this command can also start a process so you can run a local instance of the service you are intercepting.                                    |
| `leave`          | Stops an active replace, ingest, or intercept: `telepresence leave hello`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `list`           | Lists all workloads that are eligible for replace, ingest, or intercept.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `loglevel`       | Temporarily change the log-level. The default duration (30 minutes) can be altered using `-d <duration>`.  The flags `--local-only` and `--remote-only` can be used to alter the scope of the change.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `quit`           | Tell Telepresence daemons to quit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `replace`        | Replace a container to get access to its traffic, mounted volumes and environment variables: `telepresence replace <workload name> --container <container name> --env-file <file>` When used with a `--` separator, this command can also start a process so you can run a local instance of the replaced container.                                                                                               |
